# BrickBall
Run the python code
Give an input of a square matrix (for eg: enter the size of NxN matrix:7)
Then Enter the brick's position and the brick type..the 1st two index represent position of the number in a matrix the 3rd one represents value.
Make sure you give space after entering each number(eg:Enter the brick's position and the brick type :3 3 1 or 3 2 RD or 4 3 B),otherwise it will generate error
if you want to continue press "Y" else "N"(eg:Do you want to continue(Y or N)?N)
then input the ball count(Ball count is  3)
Then Enter the direction in which the ball need to traverse in capitals eg:(ST,LD,RD) which denotes stay,ledt diagonal,right diagonal
you are good to go from there
there will be some errors at the end when it comes to 2nd and 3rd turn my ball will stay in the same yet the game continues
